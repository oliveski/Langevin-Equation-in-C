# Langevin-Equation-in-C
C program that integrates Lagevin's Equation in an harmonic oscillator potential for N particles. It uses GSL's pseudo-random number generation interface and so it is necessary to have GSL installed to compile it. Velocity autocorrelation function is measured as well as potential energy and kinectic energy as functions of time (which averages to KbT/2).
